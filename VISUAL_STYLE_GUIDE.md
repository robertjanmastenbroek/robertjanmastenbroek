# Visual Style Guide
## Robert-Jan Mastenbroek | Ancient Truth. Future Sound.

This document defines your visual aesthetic based on your reference images and brand identity.

## Core Aesthetic: **Ancient × Futuristic**

Your visual identity lives at the intersection of two worlds:
- **Ancient/Tribal:** Weathered textures, earth tones, sacred objects, timeless mystery
- **Futuristic/White:** Clean lines, chrome, high-tech minimalism, sacred geometry

This fusion creates **visual Subtle Salt** — the ancient truth hidden in future sound.

## Visual Motifs & Symbols

### Ancient/Tribal Elements
- **Weathered fabrics** (linen, burlap, aged cloth)
- **Sacred vessels** (pottery, vials, ancient containers)
- **Tribal jewelry** (gold bands, bronze ornaments, beaded elements)
- **Natural textures** (sand, stone, wood grain)
- **Hooded/robed figures** (mystery, pilgrimage aesthetic)
- **Earth and fire** (grounded, primal energy)

### Futuristic Elements
- **Chrome and metal** (polished surfaces, reflective armor)
- **Sacred geometry** (triangles, diamonds, hexagons)
- **Minimalist white** (clean, ethereal, heavenly)
- **Technological augmentation** (subtle cyborg elements, metallic face masks)
- **Angular architecture** (sharp lines, crystalline forms)
- **LED/glow effects** (subtle blue energy, inner light)

### Hybrid Elements (Best of Both)
- **Ancient artifact + futuristic material** (stone relic in chrome case)
- **Tribal symbols rendered in LED** (sacred geometry glowing)
- **Weathered fabric with tech elements** (hood with metallic trim)
- **Organic face + geometric mask** (human warmth behind future form)

## Photography & Artwork Direction

### Portrait Style
**Reference images showed clear approach:**

1. **Centered composition** (subject directly facing camera)
2. **High contrast lighting** (dramatic shadows or pure white backdrops)
3. **Minimal background** (remove distractions, focus on subject)
4. **Symmetrical framing** (balanced, authoritative presence)
5. **Direct eye contact or obscured face** (connection or mystery, not in-between)

### Color Grading Options

**Option A: Ancient/Warm**
- Desaturated earth tones
- Warm highlights (golden hour feel)
- Textured, tactile, weathered
- Film grain for timeless quality

**Option B: Futuristic/Cool**
- High-key white or low-key black
- Cool blue accents
- Crisp, ultra-sharp focus
- Clean, almost clinical perfection

**Option C: Hybrid (Recommended)**
- Start with ancient/warm base
- Add futuristic/cool accents (glowing eyes, chrome elements)
- Blend both worlds in single image

## Thumbnail & Cover Art Rules

Based on your aesthetic and YouTube optimization:

### Composition
1. **Center the subject** - Face or key element dead-center
2. **High contrast** - Dark vs. light, ancient vs. future
3. **Sacred geometry** - Triangles, diamonds framing the subject
4. **Minimal text** - Your name + "Ancient Truth. Future Sound." only
5. **Breathing room** - Don't crowd edges (mobile crop consideration)

### Typography
- **Primary:** Bold, geometric, uppercase (e.g., "ROBERT-JAN MASTENBROEK")
- **Secondary:** Clean sans-serif, lighter weight (e.g., "Ancient Truth. Future Sound.")
- **Avoid:** Decorative fonts, script, anything "churchy"

### Color Blocking
- Dark background + light subject (or inverse)
- ONE accent color max per image (gold or blue, not both)
- 70/30 rule: 70% one tone, 30% contrast

## Reference Artists & Visuals

### Music/Visual Artists (Your Benchmarks)
- **Anyma** - Scale, production value, tech-forward
- **Rüfüs Du Sol** - Mood, depth, emotional resonance
- **Argy** - Tribal elements, techno texture

### Visual References (General Aesthetic)
- **Blade Runner 2049** - Minimalist futurism, sacred architecture
- **Dune (2021)** - Desert mysticism, ancient future blend
- **Ex Machina** - Clean tech, human/machine boundary
- **Mad Max: Fury Road** - Weathered future, tribal reclamation

---

## Do's and Don'ts

### ✅ DO
- Mix ancient textures with futuristic forms
- Use high contrast (dark/light, old/new)
- Center your compositions
- Keep backgrounds minimal
- Use symmetry and sacred geometry
- Show craftsmanship and detail
- Maintain mystery (hooded figures, obscured faces)
- Use metallic accents (gold, bronze, silver, chrome)

### ❌ DON'T
- Use obvious Christian imagery (crosses, doves, church buildings)
- Add cheesy light rays or halos
- Use overly decorative or "worship" fonts
- Include text-heavy designs
- Crowd the composition
- Mix too many colors (keep it restrained)
- Use stock "DJ at turntables" photos (overused, generic)
- Copy other artists' exact style (find your unique blend)

## Practical Application

### YouTube Thumbnails
1. **Template:** Dark background → centered subject → minimal text
2. **Face visibility:** Either fully visible OR artistically obscured (no awkward half-hidden)
3. **Text overlay:** "ROBERT-JAN MASTENBROEK" top, "Ancient Truth. Future Sound." bottom (small, subtle)
4. **Branding consistency:** Same font, same layout structure, always

### Instagram Posts
- **Square crop:** 1:1 ratio, center-weighted composition
- **Carousel potential:** Show progression (ancient → hybrid → future)
- **Captions:** Subtle Salt protocol (see BRAND_DNA.md)

### Album/Single Artwork
- **Primary focus:** One strong visual concept
- **Legibility:** Title must read clearly at 200×200px (Spotify thumbnail size)
- **Consistency:** Family resemblance across all releases (your "visual signature")

## Image Generation Prompts (AI)

When using AI image generation (Midjourney, DALL-E, etc.), use these base prompts:

### Ancient/Tribal Style:
```
"Hooded figure in weathered linen robes holding a glowing ancient vessel,
desert sand backdrop, bronze tribal jewelry, turquoise accents,
centered composition, high contrast lighting, cinematic, Blade Runner meets Dune"
```

### Futuristic/White Style:
```
"Minimalist portrait, chrome metallic face mask with blue LED eyes,
angular geometric shoulder armor, pure white background,
centered symmetrical composition, ultra high contrast, sacred geometry elements"
```

### Hybrid Style (Recommended):
```
"Portrait emerging from weathered white hood, face half ancient stone half chrome metal,
glowing blue geometric symbols, centered composition, dark background,
sacred geometry frame, cinematic lighting, Anyma visual aesthetic"
```

**Always add:** `--ar 16:9` (for thumbnails) or `--ar 1:1` (for album art)

## Brand Consistency Checklist

Before publishing any visual:
- [ ] Does it blend ancient + futuristic elements?
- [ ] Is the composition centered and high-contrast?
- [ ] Is text minimal and legible?
- [ ] Does it avoid obvious Christian imagery?
- [ ] Could this sit next to Anyma/Rüfüs/Argy and feel credible?
- [ ] Does it create mystery and discovery (not announcement)?
- [ ] Is it recognizably "yours" at a glance?

## File Naming Convention

Keep organized:
```
YYYYMMDD_Type_Title_Version
```

Examples:
- `20260204_Thumbnail_LiveSet_Tenerife_v1.jpg`
- `20260204_AlbumArt_Awakening_Final.jpg`
- `20260204_Instagram_AnnounceTour_Option2.jpg`
